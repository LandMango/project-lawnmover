# project-lawnmover
We will be creating an environment where we implement two algorithms in order to solve the alternating disk problem. This involves us creating
pseudocode for both the lawnmower algorithm and the alternate algorithm. We would then mathematically analyze these two using definition
or limit theorem. Lastly, we implement these two algorithms.
